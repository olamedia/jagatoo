Ant build file for running JiBX binding compiler. This file is included for easy
use from an IDE. It's not needed if you're running from the console, since the
main build.xml includes the "bind" target for the same purpose.

  <!-- The following block is intended to set the jibx-home location. It first
   checks the relative location of the JiBX libraries when this starter example
   is run directly from the JiBX distribution, then (if that fails), looks for
   an environmental variable JIBX_HOME with the installation path. If you prefer
   to just set the path directly in this file, uncomment the following line and
   set the value to the appropriate directory, then delete the rest of the Ant
   commands down to the end of this block. -->
